# SimulacaoVLC

(Work in Progress)

SimulacaoVLC is a set of MATLAB apps for planning, simulating and decoding VLC scenarios at [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/)'s optoelectronics laboratory.
It currently consists of two apps:
- **SimVLC**
- **FrameGen**

## How to Open/Run
Both apps were developed using MATLAB version 2019b and require the following add-ons and toolboxes:
- App Designer;
- Communications Toolbox;
- DSP System Toolbox;
- Mapping Toolbox;

Alternatively, the MATLAB compiler can also be used to create standalone desktop applications so that they can be run in computers that do not have MATLAB and/or the aforementioned add-ons or toolboxes.
