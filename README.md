# SimulacaoVLC

(Work in Progress)

SimulacaoVLC is a set of MATLAB apps for planning, simulating and decoding VLC scenarios at [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/)'s optoelectronics laboratory.

It currently consists of two apps:
- **SimVLC**
- **FrameGen**

## How to Open/Run
Both apps were developed using MATLAB version 2019b and require the following add-ons and toolboxes:
- [App Designer](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/app-designer.html);
- [Communications Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/communications.html);
- [DSP System Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/dsp-system.html);
- [Mapping Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/mapping.html);

To open an app, first open MATLAB and type the following command in the command window:
>appdesigner

Doing so, will open MATLAB App Designer from which the `.mlapp` file can be opened and run.

Alternatively, the MATLAB compiler can also be used to create standalone desktop applications so that they can be run in computers that do not have MATLAB and/or the aforementioned add-ons or toolboxes installed.
